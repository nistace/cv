        <p class='quote'>665 million years ago, the first "animals" appear. The strongest, fastest, smartest and most adaptable ones will survive and eventually be replaced by an even better species. Let's discover their story...</p>
        <p>Well, not quite there yet... Evolution creatures is a little simulation in which different creatures species (oddly looking like bugs) have to do their best to survive. Pursuing this objective, the creatures will eat, reproduce, age, maybe fight other species or even start cannibalism.</p>
        <p>Every creature has its own appearance and capabilities, including speed, hunger factor, gestation time and time before egg hatching. Only the genetically favoured ones will be efficient enough to create a progeny keeping the species alive.</p>

        <p>The Bubies is a game about little teams of entities called <i>Bubies</i>. The main character of each team is called the <i>MotherBubie</i>. Its objective is to collect blue stuff called <i>Gel</i> to create other entities or to transform it into <i>Fat</i> in order to get bigger.</p>
        <p>The other entities are regrouped under classes, each class receiving a common order from the player (or the AI). The different orders are gathering <i>Gel</i>, transforming it into <i>Fat</i>, protect the MotherBubie or attack nearest enemies.</p>
        <p>Once there is only one team left, the game is over.</p>
        <ul class='resume-info'><li>At every game, the AI checks if it made a better score, in which case its parameters are saved for the next games</li></ul>

        <p>In this prototype, the players take control of a little soldier : movement with the keyboard and look direction with the mouse pointer.</p>
        <p>One feature exposed in this prototype is the collision detection between the shot bullets and the walls or other entities, or between the different entities themselves.</p>
        <p>Another feature is this other soldier who can be given orders of movement by right-clicking on any position of the screen. He will then find the optimal way to get there if it is possible.</p>
